            in connection with your registration is truthful and accurate; and

            <span>1.2. Account Responsibilities.</span> You are responsible for
            all activities that occur under your Account. You agree to
            immediately notify Casho of any unauthorized use or suspected

            <span>(a) Fetching data.</span> In order to store your User Data in
            Casho, you must connect a third-party platform (e.g., your Amazon
            account, your Google account, your Flipkart account, etc.) (each a
            “Connection”) to Casho. Casho will provide the opportunity for you
            to login to the Connection via the Mobile App creating an
            authorization token that is stored with Casho on your behalf, which
            provides your account with ongoing access to the Connection and the
            embedded data therein (the process, “Making/Made a Connection”).
            After Making a Connection, you will have access to Insights and
            Rewards. You may disconnect a Connection at any time and no new data
            will be fetched until you reconnect.

            social networks; our clients, partnered brands, retailers and
            agencies (collectively, "Participating Businesses"). By Sharing your

          <p class="page-content">
            <span>1.5. Referrals.</span> We may offer bonus Points (as defined
            below) when someone you refer becomes a user of the Service (a
            “Referral Program”). Any such Referral Program may be subject to
            additional terms and conditions set forth in the offer or App, at
            Casho’s sole discretion.
          </p>

          <p class="page-content">
            You agree that you have obtained all necessary permissions and
            consents from an individual before referring that individual to
            Casho and will inform the individual: (a) that we are not the sender
            or initiator of any messages or communications that you send to that
            individual relating to the Referral Program; (b) that you are not
            acting as our agent in sending any such messages or communications;
            and (c) that you may be receiving a referral bonus if the individual
            becomes a new user of Casho. We do not directly send any referral
            codes to individuals.

          <p class="page-content">
            Current or inactive former users of the Service cannot qualify as
            new users for purposes of a Referral Program, and any attempt to
            create referrals to non-existent individuals or to multiple accounts
            for the same individual will be void and are in violation of these
            Terms. We reserve the right to void or take any other action we deem
            appropriate with respect to referrals, including if a referral code
            is shared in a social media post or from a social media account that
            contains offensive, harassing, violent, pornographic, or otherwise
            inappropriate content. Casho may discontinue and/or revoke any
            Referral Program or incentive program in its sole discretion at any
            time without notice. Casho reserves the right to decline to award
            referral bonuses, rescind bonus Rewards credited, or take any other

            authorize CASHO to record and analyze your actions related to Making
            Connections and Sharing in order to calculate an accrual of Points.

            on certain actions, activities, or transactions related to your
            Casho Account. Points are accrued, and your Point balance (“Point
            Balance”) is displayed in your Casho Account on the Mobile App. At
            this time, as long as your Casho Account remains open and in Good
            Standing, Points will accrue in the manner described. Points may be
            rescinded if Casho determines, in its sole discretion, that the
            Points were awarded to you in error, corresponding actions have been
            rescinded, or if there is fraudulent activity in your Data Vault,
            Connections, or Casho Account. If you believe that you are eligible
            for Points that were rescinded or that you have not received, or
            that you received Points that were calculated erroneously, please
            contact us.
